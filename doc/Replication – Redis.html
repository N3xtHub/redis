            <span id="replication" class="anchor"></span><h1><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#replication" class="anchor-link">*</a>Replication</h1>
            
            <p>Redis replication is a very simple to use and configure master-slave
            replication that allows slave Redis servers to be exact copies of
            master servers. The following are some very important facts about Redis
            replication:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><p>Redis uses asynchronous replication. Starting with Redis 2.8,
            however, slaves will periodically acknowledge the amount of data
            processed from the replication stream.</p></li>
            <li><p>A master can have multiple slaves.</p></li>
            <li><p>Slaves are able to accept connections from other slaves. Aside from
            connecting a number of slaves to the same master, slaves can also be
            connected to other slaves in a graph-like structure.</p></li>
            <li><p>Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side. This means that
            the master will continue to handle queries when one or more slaves perform
            the initial synchronization.</p></li>
            <li><p>Replication is also non-blocking on the slave side. While the slave is performing
            the initial synchronization, it can handle queries using the old version of
            the dataset, assuming you configured Redis to do so in redis.conf.
            Otherwise, you can configure Redis slaves to return an error to clients if the
            replication stream is down. However, after the initial sync, the old dataset
            must be deleted and the new one must be loaded. The slave will block incoming
            connections during this brief window.</p></li>
            <li><p>Replication can be used both for scalability, in order to have
            multiple slaves for read-only queries (for example, heavy <a href="http://redis.io/commands/sort">SORT</a>
            operations can be offloaded to slaves), or simply for data redundancy.</p></li>
            <li><p>It is possible to use replication to avoid the cost of having the master write the full dataset to disk: just configure your master <code>redis.conf</code> to avoid saving (just comment all the "save" directives), then connect a slave configured to save from time to time. However in this setup make sure masters don't restart automatically (please read the next section for more information).</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <span id="safety-of-replication-when-master-has-persistence-turned-off" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#safety-of-replication-when-master-has-persistence-turned-off" class="anchor-link">*</a>Safety of replication when master has persistence turned off</h2>
            
            <p>In setups where Redis replication is used, it is strongly advised to have
            persistence turned on in the master, or when this is not possible, for example
            because of latency concerns, instances should be configured to <strong>avoid restarting
            automatically</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>To better understand why masters with persistence turned off configured to
            auto restart are dangerous, check the following failure mode where data
            is wiped from the master and all its slaves:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>We have a setup with node A acting as master, with persistence turned down, and nodes B and C replicating from node A.</li>
            <li>A crashes, however it has some auto-restart system, that restarts the process. However since persistence is turned off, the node restarts with an empty data set.</li>
            <li>Nodes B and C will replicate from A, which is empty, so they'll effectively destroy their copy of the data.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>When Redis Sentinel is used for high availability, also turning off persistence
            on the master, together with auto restart of the process, is dangerous. For example the master can restart fast enough for Sentinel to don't detect a failure, so that the failure mode described above happens.</p>
            
            <p>Every time data safety is important, and replication is used with master configured without persistence, auto restart of instances should be disabled.</p>
            
            <span id="how-redis-replication-works" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#how-redis-replication-works" class="anchor-link">*</a>How Redis replication works</h2>
            
            <p>If you set up a slave, upon connection it sends a SYNC command. It doesn't
            matter if it's the first time it has connected or if it's a reconnection.</p>
            
            <p>The master then starts background saving, and starts to buffer all new
            commands received that will modify the dataset. When the background
            saving is complete, the master transfers the database file to the slave,
            which saves it on disk, and then loads it into memory. The master will
            then send to the slave all buffered commands. This is done as a
            stream of commands and is in the same format of the Redis protocol itself.</p>
            
            <p>You can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while the
            server is doing some work and issue the <a href="http://redis.io/commands/sync">SYNC</a> command. You'll see a bulk
            transfer and then every command received by the master will be re-issued
            in the telnet session.</p>
            
            <p>Slaves are able to automatically reconnect when the master &lt;-&gt;
            slave link goes down for some reason. If the master receives multiple
            concurrent slave synchronization requests, it performs a single
            background save in order to serve all of them.</p>
            
            <p>When a master and a slave reconnects after the link went down, a full resync
            is always performed. However, starting with Redis 2.8, a partial resynchronization
            is also possible.</p>
            
            <span id="partial-resynchronization" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#partial-resynchronization" class="anchor-link">*</a>Partial resynchronization</h2>
            
            <p>Starting with Redis 2.8, master and slave are usually able to continue the
            replication process without requiring a full resynchronization after the
            replication link went down.</p>
            
            <p>This works by creating an in-memory backlog of the replication stream on the
            master side. The master and all the slaves agree on a <em>replication
            offset</em> and a <em>master run id</em>, so when the link goes down, the slave will
            reconnect and ask the master to continue the replication. Assuming the
            master run id is still the same, and that the offset specified is available
            in the replication backlog, replication will resume from the point where it left off.
            If either of these conditions are unmet, a full resynchronization is performed
            (which is the normal pre-2.8 behavior). As the run id of the connected master is not
            persisted to disk, a full resynchronization is needed when the slave restarts.</p>
            
            <p>The new partial resynchronization feature uses the <code>PSYNC</code> command internally,
            while the old implementation uses the <a href="http://redis.io/commands/sync">SYNC</a> command. Note that a Redis 2.8
            slave is able to detect if the server it is talking with does not support
            <code>PSYNC</code>, and will use <a href="http://redis.io/commands/sync">SYNC</a> instead.</p>
            
            <span id="diskless-replication" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#diskless-replication" class="anchor-link">*</a>Diskless replication</h2>
            
            <p>Normally a full resynchronization requires to create an RDB file on disk,
            then reload the same RDB from disk in order to feed the slaves with the data.</p>
            
            <p>With slow disks this can be a very stressing operation for the master.
            Redis version 2.8.18 will be the first version to have experimental support
            for diskless replication. In this setup the child process directly sends the
            RDB over the wire to slaves, without using the disk as intermediate storage.</p>
            
            <p>The feature is currently considered experimental.</p>
            
            <span id="configuration" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#configuration" class="anchor-link">*</a>Configuration</h2>
            
            <p>To configure replication is trivial: just add the following line to the slave
            configuration file:</p>
            
            <pre><code>slaveof 192.168.1.1 6379
</code></pre>
            
            <p>Of course you need to replace 192.168.1.1 6379 with your master IP address (or
            hostname) and port. Alternatively, you can call the <a href="http://redis.io/commands/slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> command and the
            master host will start a sync with the slave.</p>
            
            <p>There are also a few parameters for tuning the replication backlog taken
            in memory by the master to perform the partial resynchronization. See the example
            <code>redis.conf</code> shipped with the Redis distribution for more information.</p>
            
            <p>Diskless replication can be enabled using the <code>repl-diskless-sync</code> configuration
            parameter. The delay to start the transfer in order to wait more slaves to
            arrive after the first one, is controlled by the <code>repl-diskless-sync-delay</code>
            parameter. Please refer to the example <code>redis.conf</code> file in the Redis distribution
            for more details.</p>
            
            <span id="read-only-slave" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#read-only-slave" class="anchor-link">*</a>Read-only slave</h2>
            
            <p>Since Redis 2.6, slaves support a read-only mode that is enabled by default.
            This behavior is controlled by the <code>slave-read-only</code> option in the redis.conf file, and can be enabled and disabled at runtime using <a href="http://redis.io/commands/config-set">CONFIG SET</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Read-only slaves will reject all write commands, so that it is not possible to write to a slave because of a mistake. This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a slave instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like <code>DEBUG</code> or <code>CONFIG</code> are still enabled. However, security of read-only instances can be improved by disabling commands in redis.conf using the <code>rename-command</code> directive.</p>
            
            <p>You may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting
            and have slave instances that can be target of write operations.
            While those writes will be discarded if the slave and the master
            resynchronize or if the slave is restarted, there are a few legitimate
            use case for storing ephemeral data in writable slaves. However in the future
            it is possible that this feature will be dropped.</p>
            
            <span id="setting-a-slave-to-authenticate-to-a-master" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#setting-a-slave-to-authenticate-to-a-master" class="anchor-link">*</a>Setting a slave to authenticate to a master</h2>
            
            <p>If your master has a password via <code>requirepass</code>, it's trivial to configure the
            slave to use that password in all sync operations.</p>
            
            <p>To do it on a running instance, use <code>redis-cli</code> and type:</p>
            
            <pre><code>config set masterauth &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>
            
            <p>To set it permanently, add this to your config file:</p>
            
            <pre><code>masterauth &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>
            
            <span id="allow-writes-only-with-n-attached-replicas" class="anchor"></span><h2><a href="http://redis.io/topics/replication#allow-writes-only-with-n-attached-replicas" class="anchor-link">*</a>Allow writes only with N attached replicas</h2>
            
            <p>Starting with Redis 2.8, it is possible to configure a Redis master to
            accept write queries only if at least N slaves are currently connected to the
            master.</p>
            
            <p>However, because Redis uses asynchronous replication it is not possible to ensure
            the slave actually received a given write, so there is always a window for data
            loss.</p>
            
            <p>This is how the feature works:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Redis slaves ping the master every second, acknowledging the amount of replication stream processed.</li>
            <li>Redis masters will remember the last time it received a ping from every slave.</li>
            <li>The user can configure a minimum number of slaves that have a lag not greater than a maximum number of seconds.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If there are at least N slaves, with a lag less than M seconds, then the write will be accepted.</p>
            
            <p>You may think at it as a relaxed version of the "C" in the CAP theorem, where consistency is not ensured for a given write, but at least the time window for data loss is restricted to a given number of seconds.</p>
            
            <p>If the conditions are not met, the master will instead reply with an error and the write will not be accepted.</p>
            
            <p>There are two configuration parameters for this feature:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>min-slaves-to-write <code>&lt;number of slaves&gt;</code></li>
            <li>min-slaves-max-lag <code>&lt;number of seconds&gt;</code></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For more information, please check the example <code>redis.conf</code> file shipped with the
            Redis source distribution.</p>
